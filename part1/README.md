# **HBnB Evolution - Technical Documentation**

## **Introduction**

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the HBnB Evolution project. HBnB is a simplified version of an AirBbB-like application that allows users to manage listings, submit reviews, and manage amenities . This document outlines the systemâ€™s architecture, detailed class design, and sequence diagrams of various API interactions.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this document is to guide the implementation of the HBnB application by providing a clear and detailed blueprint for its architecture and business
logic.

**This document includes:**
- General architecture diagrams.
- Business logic details.
- Sequence diagrams for API flows.

**Scope:**
- **User Management:** Registration, profile updates, and user deletion.
- **Place Management:** Listing places, updating, and deleting properties.
- **Review Management:** Submitting and managing reviews for places.
- **Amenity Management:** Managing amenities associated with places.

## **High-Level Architecture**

### **High-Level Package Diagram**

```mermaid
classDiagram
class PresentationLayer {
    <<Interface>>
    +ServiceAPI
}
class BusinessLogicLayer {
    +ModelClasses
}
class PersistenceLayer {
    +DatabaseAccess
}
PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : Facade Pattern
BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : Database Operations
```

### **Explanation of the Architecture**
1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - Handles user interactions and API endpoints.
    - Exposes services for user actions such as registration, place creation, review submission, and fetching data.
2. **Business Logic Layer:**:
    - Contains the core business logic and models representing entities like User, Place, Review, and Amenity.
3. **Persistence Layer:**:
    - Responsible for database operations, data storage, and retrieval.

**Facade Pattern:** The facade pattern simplifies interactions between layers by providing a unified interface through which the Presentation Layer communicates with the Business Logic Layer.

### **Class Diagram**

```mermaid
classDiagram
class User {
    +UUID id
    +String first_name
    +String last_name
    +String email
    +String password
    +Boolean is_admin
    +DateTime created_at
    +DateTime updated_at
    +register()
    +updateProfile()
    +delete()
}

class Place {
    +UUID id
    +String title
    +String description
    +Float price
    +Float latitude
    +Float longitude
    +UUID owner_id
    +List~UUID~ amenity_ids
    +DateTime created_at
    +DateTime updated_at
    +create()
    +update()
    +delete()
    +list()
}

class Review {
    +UUID id
    +UUID place_id
    +UUID user_id
    +Integer rating
    +String comment
    +DateTime created_at
    +DateTime updated_at
    +create()
    +update()
    +delete()
    +listByPlace()
}

class Amenity {
    +UUID id
    +String name
    +String description
    +DateTime created_at
    +DateTime updated_at
    +create()
    +update()
    +delete()
    +list()
}

User "1" --> "0..*" Place : owns
Place "1" --> "0..*" Review : has
User "1" --> "0..*" Review : writes
Place "0..*" --> "0..*" Amenity : has
```

### **Explanation of the Class Diagram**
- **User:** Manages user data, registration, profile updates, and deletion.
- **Place:** Handles property listings, updates, deletions, and associations with amenities.
- **Review:** Manages reviews for places, including creation, updates, and deletions.
- **Amenity:** Manages amenities and their association with places.

## **API Interaction Flow**

### **Sequence Diagrams for API Calls**

#### **User Registration:** Ensures data validation before storing user information.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant API
participant BusinessLogic
participant Database

User->>API: Register User
API->>BusinessLogic: Validate Data
BusinessLogic->>Database: Save User Data
Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirm Save
BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Success
API-->>User: Registration Success
```

#### **Place Creation:** Validates and stores new place data.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant API
participant BusinessLogic
participant Database

User->>API: Create Place
API->>BusinessLogic: Validate and Process Request
BusinessLogic->>Database: Save Place Data
Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirm Save
BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Success
API-->>User: Place Created
```

#### **Review Submission:** Handles review creation and ensures it is associated with the correct place and user.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant API
participant BusinessLogic
participant Database

User->>API: Submit Review
API->>BusinessLogic: Validate and Process Review
BusinessLogic->>Database: Save Review Data
Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirm Save
BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Success
API-->>User: Review Submitted
```

#### **Fetching a List of Places:** Retrieves and returns a list of places based on user criteria.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant API
participant BusinessLogic
participant Database

User->>API: Request Place List
API->>BusinessLogic: Process Request
BusinessLogic->>Database: Retrieve Places
Database-->>BusinessLogic: Return Place Data
BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Data
API-->>User: List of Places
```
